🧠 Java
Java is a powerful, versatile, and platform-independent programming language. It was released by Sun Microsystems in 1995 and follows the “Write Once, Run Anywhere (WORA)” principle — meaning a program written in Java can run on any device or operating system that has a Java Virtual Machine (JVM). Java’s combination of object-oriented design, robust memory management, strong security, and vast ecosystem makes it a top choice for building web applications, enterprise software, mobile apps (Android), and cloud-based microservices.

---------------------------------------------

⚙️ 1. Core Identity

* Type: Object-oriented, class-based, and statically typed language.
* Execution Model: Code is compiled into bytecode which runs on the JVM, making it platform-independent.
* Design Goals: Portability, reliability, security, and backward compatibility.

---------------------------------------------

🧩 2. Java Architecture

| Component                      | Description                                                     |
| -------------------------------| --------------------------------------------------------------- |
| JDK (Java Development Kit)     | Includes JRE + development tools (compiler, debugger, etc.)     |
| JRE (Java Runtime Environment) | Provides JVM and core libraries to run Java programs            |
| JVM (Java Virtual Machine)     | Executes bytecode, manages memory, threads, and JIT compilation |

Execution Flow:
Source Code (.java) → javac → Bytecode (.class) → JVM executes it

---------------------------------------------

🧱 3. Object-Oriented Foundations

Java is fully object-oriented, promoting modular and maintainable code.

| Principle     | Meaning                                 | Example                          |
| --------------| --------------------------------------- | -------------------------------- |
| Encapsulation | Bundle data and behavior                | Private fields + getters/setters |
| Inheritance   | Reuse properties from parent class      | `class Car extends Vehicle`      |
| Polymorphism  | One interface, multiple implementations | `draw()` in `Circle`, `Square`   |
| Abstraction   | Hiding internal logic from the user     | Abstract classes, interfaces     |

---------------------------------------------

⚡ 4. Memory Management

Java uses automatic garbage collection to manage memory efficiently.

| Area                       | Purpose                                    |
| ---------------------------| ------------------------------------------ |
| Heap                       | Stores objects and instance variables      |
| Stack                      | Holds local variables and method calls     |
| Method Area                | Stores class metadata and static variables |
| PC Register & Native Stack | Track thread execution and native code     |

Garbage collectors like G1, ZGC, and Shenandoah handle memory cleanup automatically.

---------------------------------------------

🧠 5. Key Features

* Platform Independence — runs on any JVM.
* Strong Type Checking — errors caught at compile time.
* Automatic Memory Management — GC handles allocation and cleanup.
* Multithreading — true concurrent programming support.
* Rich Standard Library — includes utilities for I/O, networking, collections, etc.
* Security — sandboxing, class loaders, and bytecode verification.
* Functional Programming (Java 8+) — lambdas and streams.

---------------------------------------------

🧰 6. Core Libraries and Frameworks

* Collections Framework: List, Set, Map, Queue
* I/O and NIO: Files, Streams, Buffers
* Concurrency Utilities: ExecutorService, Locks, CompletableFuture
* JDBC: Database connectivity
* Spring / Spring Boot: Enterprise and microservice frameworks
* JUnit & Mockito: Testing and mocking frameworks

---------------------------------------------

🚀 7. JVM Internals & Performance

* JIT (Just-In-Time Compiler): Converts hot bytecode paths to native code for faster execution.
* ClassLoader: Dynamically loads classes into memory.
* Garbage Collectors: Automatically reclaim unused objects.
* Thread Model: Supports lightweight concurrency and synchronization via `synchronized`, `Lock`, and `volatile`.

---------------------------------------------

🧩 8. Modern Java Enhancements (Java 11 → 21)

| Feature          | Description                                                  |
| ---------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `var` keyword    | Local variable type inference                                |
| Text Blocks      | Multi-line string literals `""" ... """`                     |
| Records          | Immutable data holders (record User(String name, int age)`) |
| Pattern Matching | Cleaner `instanceof` and `switch` syntax                     |
| Sealed Classes   | Restrict subclassing                                         |
| Virtual Threads  | Lightweight threads introduced in Java 21                    |

---------------------------------------------

🧭 9. Common Use Cases

* Enterprise Applications → via Spring Boot, Hibernate
* Mobile Development → Android SDK uses Java (Kotlin-compatible)
* Cloud and Microservices → Spring Cloud, Quarkus, Micronaut
* Financial Systems → Multithreaded, reliable processing
* Big Data → Hadoop and Spark components written in Java
